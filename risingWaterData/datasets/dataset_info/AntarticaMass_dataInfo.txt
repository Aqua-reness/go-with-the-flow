HDR Data from the GRACE JPL RL05M.1 Mascon Solution: Version 2
HDR
HDR This file contains values that are anomalies relative to April 2002 computed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory under the
HDR auspices of the NASA MEaSUREs program. The Antarctic mass anomalies are generated using GRACE data from the JPL RL05M.1
HDR Mascon Solution: Version 2 (https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/TELLUS_GRACE_MASCON_CRI_GRID_RL05_V2).

HDR NOTES (1): Correction for Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) is from Ivins et al. (2013), doi:10.1002/jgrb.50208
HDR            This GIA correction is different than what is applied in the official GRACE JPL RL05M.1 Solution
HDR NOTES (2): Trend value is derived by performing a weighted least squares fit of an annual, semiannual, bias, and trend to the timeseries
HDR NOTES (3): Monthly uncertainties are computed using measurement errors provided in the JPL RL05M.1 Solution and considering
HDR            leakage errors in accordance with Wiese et al. (2016), doi:10.1002/2016WR019344
HDR NOTES (4): The trend uncertainty provides a 1-sigma confidence interval. The calculation considers only the propagation of the monthly uncertainties
HDR            into the trend, assumes uncorrelated observations, and includes GIA uncertainty according to Velicogna et al. (2013), doi:10.1002/grl.50527
